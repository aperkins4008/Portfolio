Please see the Word Document, which will help guide you through the requirements and deliverables.  


# SCENARIO
A local police department is interested in discovering the behavior, trends, and needs of the department based on data that has been collected. As a data analyst, you have been recruited to do consulting work for the department.

# REQUIREMENTS
Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of the submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. An originality report is provided when you submit your task that can be used as a guide.
  

You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.



# Part 1:

The police chief asks you to analyze the logs from emergency 911 calls in the city and then provide a summary of that data.

B.  Explain why you removed each  column and row from the “Raw Data” spreadsheet, or why you imputed data in empty fields as you prepared the data for analysis.

•  table: date and number of events

•  bar graph: date and number of events

•  table: number of incident occurrences by event type

•  bar graph: number of incident occurrences by event type

•  table: sectors and number of events

•  bar graph: sectors and number of events

# Part 2:

The state governor has offered an additional funding incentive for police departments that are able to meet the standard of having a minimum of 2.5 officers onsite per incident.

F.  Describe the impact of the outliers on the regression model, providing graphical representations or tables as evidence to support your description.



G.  Create a residual plot and explain how to improve the linear regression model based on your interpretation of the plot.



H.  Using the linear regression analysis, explain if the department qualifies for additional state funding, including any limitations posed by the available data to the assessment of the department’s current funding eligibility.



I.  Describe the precautions or behaviors that should be exercised when working with and communicating about the sensitive data in this scenario.
