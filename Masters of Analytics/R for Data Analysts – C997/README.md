## R for Data Analysts. Population Prediction Estimation in R:

Please see the PDF document, which will help guide you through the requirements and deliverables.  


# INTRODUCTION
The United States collects and analyzes demographic data from the U.S. population. The U.S. Census Bureau provides annual estimates of the population size of each U.S. state and region. Many important decisions are made using the estimated population dynamics, including the investments in new infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals; establishing new job training centers; opening or closing schools and senior centers; and adjusting the emergency services to the size and characteristics of the demographics of metropolitan and other areas, states, or the country as a whole. The census data and estimates are publicly available on the U.S. census website. Data analysts use a variety of tools to create models for predictions, including models of population dynamics of a state of a region.


For this project, you will use R to create a linear regression model of the population dynamics of your state and predict the size of its population.


The goal is to demonstrate your skill sets with R to support the various stages of the data analytics process.

# REQUIREMENTS
Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of the submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. An originality report is provided when you submit your task that can be used as a guide.You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.


Submit one zipped folder that includes the code, input, and output files from each  part of the task. Place the responses to the task prompts one PDF file, and include the PDF file.


Note: This assessment requires you to submit pictures, graphics, and/or diagrams. Each file must be an attachment no larger than 30 MB in size. Diagrams must be original and may be hand-drawn or drawn using a graphics program. Do not use CAD programs because attachments will be too large.



A.    Create a linear regression analysis with R to predict the size of the population for the state you live in based on the “Current Estimates Data” dataset (see weblink below). Provide a screenshot of your results.



B.    Explain how you prepared the data from part A and how the dataset was imported into R, including screenshots of your results.



C.    Create an R script that will tabulate a statistical description of the model using R’s summary() function and provide a screenshot of your results.



D.   Predict the population size of your state in five years using a linear regression from part A and provide a screenshot of your results.



E.   Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.



F.   Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
