# INTRODUCTION
For my capstone I identified an original real-data research question and proposed a project to address it.

# RESEARCH QUESTION AND HYPTHOSEIS 


**Research Question:** Can a Random Forest model be constructed based upon the survey salary dataset?

**Hypothesis:**

*H0:* A Random Forest model cannot be formulated on the survey salary dataset.

*H1:* A Random Forest can be constructed on the survey salary dataset.

# ABSTRACT

“

The study exists to create a predictive model which can predict Data Professionals Salaries in order to aid graduating students with functional and targeted market research. This study will utilize a Random Forest regression model in order to analyze the significance of particular predictor variables within the salary data survey. The predominant goals will be to identify which variables best predict the salary amounts for Data Professionals while also constructing an accurate model. According to Donges (2020), a Random Forest model is a supervised learning algorithm which merges decision trees in an ensemble type of methodology. Donges (2020) also found that utilizing a Random Forest regression model can help predict both classification and continuous variable alike. Aasim (2019) hypothesized that salary positions data can be descriptive enough to predict salaries while utilizing Random Forest. Therefore, by thoughtful and thorough understanding of the classification and discrete predictor variables, as well as their relationship between the salary, it should be possible to predict this response variable (Koehrsen, 2017).

## Note:

“

In order to provide the most value possible, a separate program has been created in parallel with this study. This parallel program is a tool which implements the KNN learning algorithm as fitted within this study. Since KNN is much faster than the MLP neural network and is also less likely to be subject to over-fitting, it was selected for use in the separate program.

The program itself uses the streamlit API as a GUI in order to provide WGU students a way to predict their Salary Tier in future years. The tool uses the final clean dataset in order to quickly train the KNN algorithm and produce fast results. Think of the program as a condensed version of this study with meaningful value to others. By giving the algorithm a variety of inputs and running the algorithm, future student scan predict what pay band they may fall into, in the years to come. Please see the Predictor_GUI folder and its documentation for program execution.
