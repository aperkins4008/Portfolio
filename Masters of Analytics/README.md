## Data Analytics Masters Portfolio:

This is a collection of my portfolio while attending Western Governors University (WGU) and receiving my Masters in Data Analytics (MSDA). You can find a variety of folders above. Each folder has a corresponding README that explains a little about each project or folder. 

Note: Some of these projects include more information on the actual project request and outline of the project. Western Governors has recently modified their MSDA program and subsequently many of the courses have been retired. Those that are not retired contain less information with the READMEs on course requirements, based upon WGU policy.
