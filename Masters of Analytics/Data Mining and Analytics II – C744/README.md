## Data Mining 2, Predicting Churn Data:

Please see the PDF document, which will help guide you through the requirements and deliverables.  


# INTRODUCTION
One of the most critical factors in customer relationship management that directly impacts a company’s long-term profitability is customer attrition. When a company can better predict if a customer is likely to cut ties, it can take a more targeted approach to mitigate customer turnover.

In this task, you will use Python, SAS, or R to analyze data for a telecommunications company (see “Customer Data” web link) and create a data mining report in a word processor (e.g., Microsoft Word). You will create visual representations throughout the submission to show each step of your work and to visually represent the findings of your data analysis.

All algorithms and visual representations used need to be captured (either in tables within the word document or with screen shots added into the word document) and should be submitted as part of your document for final submission

A separate Excel (.xls or .xlsx) document of the cleaned data should be submitted along with the written aspects of the data mining report.

# SCENARIO
You are an analyst for a telecommunications company that is concerned about the number of customers leaving their landline business for cable competitors. The company needs to know which customers are leaving and attempt to mitigate continued customer loss. You have been asked to analyze customer data to identify why customers are leaving and potential indicators to explain why those customers are leaving so the company can make an informed plan to mitigate further loss.

# REQUIREMENTS
Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of the submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. An originality report is provided when you submit your task that can be used as a guide.
 
You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.
