## Analysis of Bay Area Bike Share Data in Python

This is a project written in Python. The Bay_Area_Carl_Perkins.ipynb file houses the final deliverable written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook. This incorporates a variety of data visualizations. All the other files are either the original data, the source file or function based python files used in the final deliverable. This was the most basic project of this Nano Degree and was written in Python, mostly to teach initial concepts.
