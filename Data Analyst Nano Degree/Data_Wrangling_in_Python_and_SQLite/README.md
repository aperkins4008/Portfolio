## Data Wrangling with Python and SQLite

This is a project written in Python in conjunction with SQLite. The Dana_Wrangling_Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb file houses the final deliverable written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook. The data used for this case study was pulled from Open Street Map using the Overpass API. The data was originally imported as an OSM file, converted into CSV and finally pulled into SQLite. The primary goal of the Analysis was to learn how to effectively scrub data in Python while utilizing SQLite.

All the other files are either the original data, the source file or function based python files used in the final deliverable.
