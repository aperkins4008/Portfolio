## Investigating a Data set with Python and SQLite

This is a project written in Python in conjunction with SQLite. The Investigate.Perkins.ipynb file houses the final deliverable written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook. This report is an analysis of Soccer data provided by Hugo Mathien on Kaggle. The primary goal was to learn how to effectively investigate data in Python while utilizing SQLite. There are several nice data visualizations included.

All the other files are function based python files used in the final deliverable or the source file.
