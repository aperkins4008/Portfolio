## Enron scandal, predicting fraud using Machine Learning in Python

This is a machine learning project written in Python. The Machine_Learning_and_the_Enron_Data_Set.ipynb file houses the final deliverable written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook. The goal of this project is to analyze Persons of Interest (POI) in the Enron scandal by using machine learning algorithms in order to find patterns of relationships in the data regarding POI that may indicate precursors for fraud. The algorithms used were KNN classifier and Gaussian Naive Bayes. There are a variety of sources files and a testing script included.
