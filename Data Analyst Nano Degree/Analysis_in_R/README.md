## Analysis in R

This is a project written in R, using R Studio as a platform. The Explore_and_Summarize_Data.RMD file houses the R code written for this project. If you want to see a complete analysis without the code, instead of looking at the .RMD file, I would highly recommend clicking the link at the bottom of the page. 

The data report is focused on red wine data that contains a set of 1,599 red wine and including 11 variables of their corresponding chemical properties. Three experts also rated the quality of each wine with a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (excellent).
