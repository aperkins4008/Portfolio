## Hello There!

My name is Andrew Perkins and this is a collection of my data-nerd portfolio, last updated April, 2021. 

I have used several tools during my time in the data science field. You can find a variety of folders above, which contain lots of different projects that I have completed. My latest and most comprehensive project is my Data Analytic Masters of Science Degree Capstone; think of it like a thesis. You can find it in the Masters_Analytics folder, give it a peek. It uses 10 different machine learning algorithms and some unsupervised learning techniques as well.
